# Product Context

## 1. Why This Project Exists

This repository exists to solve a common problem in multi-platform development: maintaining consistent design across different technology stacks. As a solo developer working on both web and native applications, you need a lightweight, reliable way to ensure visual consistency while allowing for platform-specific implementation details.

The repository serves as a bridge between design and implementation, providing a single source of truth that can be consumed by any technology stack with minimal integration effort.

## 2. Problems Solved

- **Design Consistency:** Ensures consistent use of colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements across platforms.
- **Efficient Updates:** Allows for design changes to be made in one place and propagated to all consuming applications.
- **Simplified Onboarding:** Makes it easy for new developers (or future versions of yourself) to understand and implement the design system.
- **Platform Flexibility:** Provides a foundation that works equally well for web, iOS, and Android projects without favoring any particular stack.

## 3. How It Should Work

- **Single Source of Truth:** Design decisions are made and stored in the `tokens/` directory as JSON files.
- **Minimal Translation:** Platform-specific implementations in `platforms/` should be direct translations of the source tokens with minimal additional logic.
- **Asset Availability:** All brand assets (logos, icons) should be readily available in standard formats for easy integration.
- **Simple Consumption:** Applications should be able to integrate the design system through simple file copying or Git submodule/subtree.

## 4. User Experience Goals

While this repository doesn't directly implement user interfaces, it plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience by:

- Ensuring consistent visual language across all platforms
- Providing a foundation for consistent interaction patterns
- Making it easy to maintain brand integrity as applications evolve
- Reducing the likelihood of visual inconsistencies that can confuse users
