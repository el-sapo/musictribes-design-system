# Progress

## 1. What Works

- **Core Structure:** The repository's basic structure effectively separates design tokens, platform-specific implementations, and brand assets.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** The use of JSON for tokens ensures the system can be consumed by any technology stack.
- **Lightweight Approach:** The absence of a build process makes integration simple and straightforward.
- **Platform Support:** Current platform implementations (web, react-native) cover both web and mobile development needs.
- **Asset Organization:** Brand assets are well-organized and easily accessible in standard formats.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Complete analysis of repository structure and organization
- **Documentation Enhancement:** Identify opportunities to improve documentation clarity and completeness
- **Integration Improvements:** Evaluate potential enhancements to make integration easier for developers
- **Discoverability:** Assess and improve the ease with which developers can find what they need in the repository
- **Consistency Checks:** Ensure all platform implementations are equally complete and well-documented

## 3. Current Status

- **Memory Bank Setup:** Complete with all core files created and populated
- **Repository Analysis:** In progress, initial file structure review completed
- **Documentation Review:** Initial assessment complete, detailed review needed
- **Integration Workflow:** Basic understanding established, detailed evaluation needed

## 4. Known Issues

- **Documentation Depth:** While the README and USAGE.md provide a good foundation, they could benefit from more detailed implementation guides.
- **Platform Parity:** The web platform implementation appears more complete than the react-native implementation.
- **Token Documentation:** Design tokens could be better documented with usage examples and visual representations.
- **Asset Management:** While assets are organized, there could be improvements in documentation about when and how to use each asset.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Vision:** Create a lightweight, multi-platform design system that can be easily integrated into any project.
- **Current Reality:** The repository successfully achieves its core goals but has opportunities for improvement in documentation and consistency.
- **Future Direction:** Enhancements should focus on making the repository more discoverable and easier to integrate while maintaining its lightweight nature.

## 6. Next Steps

1. Complete detailed analysis of repository structure and file organization
2. Evaluate current documentation quality and identify gaps
3. Assess platform implementation completeness and consistency
4. Provide actionable recommendations for improvement
5. Suggest specific changes that will enhance portability and ease of use
