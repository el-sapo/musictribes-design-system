# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on analyzing the repository structure to identify opportunities for improving its organization, documentation, and ease of integration while maintaining its lightweight, technology-agnostic nature.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Memory Bank documentation system has been established with the creation of:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`

## 3. Next Steps

1. Complete Memory Bank setup by creating `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`
2. Analyze repository structure and file organization
3. Evaluate current documentation quality and completeness
4. Identify potential improvements to enhance portability and ease of integration
5. Provide actionable recommendations for improving the repository

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Maintaining Lightweight Nature:** Any recommendations must preserve the repository's core principle of being simple and easy to consume.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Improvements should not favor any specific technology stack.
- **Ease of Integration:** Enhancements should make it easier to integrate the design system into new projects.
- **Documentation Balance:** Documentation should be comprehensive without being overwhelming.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- **File Organization:** Files are organized by type and platform, with a flat structure for easy navigation.
- **Documentation Approach:** Documentation should be practical and focused on implementation rather than theoretical concepts.
- **Integration Philosophy:** The repository should remain consumable through simple file copying or Git operations without requiring complex setup.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- The repository successfully achieves its goal of being a lightweight, multi-platform design system.
- The current structure is functional but could benefit from minor improvements to enhance discoverability and ease of use.
- The existing documentation (README.md, USAGE.md) provides a good foundation but could be more comprehensive.
- The separation of design tokens from platform-specific implementations is well-executed.
