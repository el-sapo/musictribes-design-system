# Assets

Put raw brand assets here. Keep source files (e.g., SVG) alongside exported variants if needed.

- `logos/`: wordmarks, icons, lockups
- `icons/`: product-level icons (SVG preferred)

Recommendations
- Prefer SVG for vector; export PNGs for fallbacks
- Keep clear naming and usage notes (e.g., dark/light backgrounds)
- Avoid embedding fonts in SVG; rely on outlines when necessary
